## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The goal of this project is, given a video of a road taken from a car moving forward, to identify the lane lines and plot them on the video.

Here is a glimpse of the final result -

&nbsp;

The work is done in the following jupyter notebook: [advanced_lane_lines.ipynb](advanced_lane_lines.ipynb)

Example images of each step of the pipeline can be found here: [data/examples/](data/examples/)

The results of applying the image processing pipeline on the test images are here: [data/output_images/](data/output_images/)

The final result(plotted lanes on the project-video) can be found here: [data/output_videos/challenge_video_solution]
