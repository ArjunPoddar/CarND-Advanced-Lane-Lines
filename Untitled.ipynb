    "## Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera calibration matrix and the distortion correction coefficients are in the **Camera Calibration** section of the [advanced_lane_lines.ipynb](advanced_lane_lines.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is this part is to use known images to device a mapping function between distorted and undistorted images that when applied to other distorted images corrects the distortion. Images of chessboards are ideal candidates for this task as layout of chessboards is very mathematically structured and hence the corners on undistorted images are deterministic to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read the given 20 distorted images of chessboards. Using the ```cv2.findChessboardCorners ``` function I tried to locate the corners of the chessboard and then using the ```cv2.drawChessboardCorners``` function I plotted the corners on the respective images. Corners were found for most of the images and for some of them, I could not find any corners such as for calibration4.jpg, calibration5.jpg etc. For the images where corners were found, the image-points(corners) were stored in an array named ```imgpoint``` which is an 2D array of image points as the given images are in 2D. The known corners of the undistorted chessboards, called the object points, are stored in a 3D array named ```objpoint```. We need 3D array for object points as we are trying to correct for distortion of 3D objects projected into 2D images. As chessboards the flat, the 3rd co-ordinate in ```objpoint``` is always kept at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I used the ```cv2.calibrateCamera``` function on the image points and the object points to calculate the camera matrix and the distortion coefficients, which are then used to get the undistorted image using the ```cv2.undistort``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, image_size, None, None)\n",
    "dst = cv2.undistort(image, mtx, dist, None, mtx)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is the result of undistorting one chessboard image as test:\n",
    "\n",
    "![chess_undistort](data/pipeline_examples/undistorted_chessboard.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have saved the camera calibration results [here](data/camera_calibration.p) for later uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distortion Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients that I had saved in the previous step, I write a function called ```undistort_image``` that, given a distorted image, performs undistortion and returns a corrected image. Here is an example: \n",

    "![image_undistort](data/pipeline_examples/step1_undistorted.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Thresholding into a Binary Image: Color transforms, Gradients or other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the binary image that would aid in isolating the lane lines in the images of the road, I wrote several functions to implement different thresholding methods to get binary images:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Absolute Sobel Thresholding**: I wrote the ```abs_sobel_thresh``` function that implements  the [Sobel operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) to detect absolute changes in gradients along the X and Y axes in order to detect lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Magnitude Thresholding**: I implemented the ```mag_thresh``` function to implement a thresholding by taking the Euclidean magnitude of the gradients as measured by the Sobel method along X and Y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direction Thresholding**: To get thresholding with respect to the direction of the gradients identified by the Sobel methods, I wrote the ```dir_thresh``` function which works by measuring the angle (arctan) between Sobel operators in X and Y directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Color Space Thresholding**: To detect changes in the HLS color space of the images in order to detect lines, I impelemented the function ```hue_thresh``` and ```saturation thresh``` to detect changes in hue and saturation of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Combining all thresholds:\n",
    "Each of the thresholding techniques mentioned above detect some facets of the lines. To get a comprehensive binary image so that our downstream work of fitting mathematical equations to the lane lines becoms easier, I combined the individual methods in a function named ```combined_thresh```. Here is how they are combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def combined_thresh(img, abs_thresh = (20, 100), magnitude_thresh = (30, 100), \\\n",
    "                         angle_thresh = (0.7, 1.4), h_thresh = (10, 35), s_thresh = (120, 255)):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    gradx = abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient = 'x', sobel_kernel = 3, thresh = abs_thresh)\n",
    "    grady = abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient = 'y', sobel_kernel = 3, thresh = abs_thresh)\n",
    "    mag_binary = mag_thresh(img, sobel_kernel = 3, thresh = magnitude_thresh)\n",
    "    dir_binary = dir_thresh(img, sobel_kernel = 3, thresh = angle_thresh)\n",
    "    h_binary = hue_thresh(img, thresh = h_thresh)\n",
    "    s_binary = saturation_thresh(img, thresh = s_thresh)\n",
    "    combined_binary = np.zeros_like(gradx)\n",
    "    combined_binary[(gradx == 1) & (grady ==1) & (mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1) | (h_binary == 1) & (s_binary == 1)] = 1\n",
    "    return combined_binary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a glimpse of how the different thresholds look when applied to one of the images of the road.\n",

    "### 3. Perspective Transformation and Warping\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented perspective transformation and warping by writing a function named ```perspective_transform``` which takes in an image and first performs perspective transformation by using the ```cv2.getPerspectiveTransform``` function when given one source and a destination. Then it warps the image using the ```cv2.warpPerspective``` function and returns a warped image and two matrices ```M``` and ```Minv```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pipeline_examples/step3_perspective_transform_warping.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Lane Lines Detection and Polynomial Fitting\n",
    "I used two methods for lane lines detection and to fit polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Sliding Windows Method:\n",
    "Given a binary image that has gone through perspective transform and warping, this method (implemented in functions ```find_lane_pixels``` and ```get_polynomial```) divides the image into several horizontal windows and then detects peaks in intensity on the left and right side of frame. To do this, intensity histograms are taken into account. When all the peaks have been detected, ```np.polyfit``` is used to fit a quadratic equation to each side of the image to represent the left and the right lanes. The result of this process looks like this when applied to a test image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pipeline_examples/step4a_sliding_windows.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Search From Prior Method:\n",
    "I implemented the ```search_around_poly``` function which, gievn an image of a road and equations of lines from the left and the right lanes from the previous frame, tries to detect and fit lane lines in the current frame. It does so by reading the previous lane lines and then looking for lines within their margins. The working principle of this method is that when the camera takes images in a moving car, there is very high chance of finding the next lines around the neighborhood of the previous lines as lane lines do not change abruptly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pipeline_examples/step4b_search_from_prior.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:\n",
