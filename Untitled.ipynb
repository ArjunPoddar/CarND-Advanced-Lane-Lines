    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera calibration matrix and the distortion correction coefficients are in the **Camera Calibration** section of the [advanced_lane_lines.ipynb](advanced_lane_lines.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is this part is to use known images to device a mapping function between distorted and undistorted images that when applied to other distorted images corrects the distortion. Images of chessboards are ideal candidates for this task as layout of chessboards is very mathematically structured and hence the corners on undistorted images are deterministic to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read the given 20 distorted images of chessboards. Using the ```cv2.findChessboardCorners ``` function I tried to locate the corners of the chessboard and then using the ```cv2.drawChessboardCorners``` function I plotted the corners on the respective images. Corners were found for most of the images and for some of them, I could not find any corners such as for calibration4.jpg, calibration5.jpg etc. For the images where corners were found, the image-points(corners) were stored in an array named ```imgpoint``` which is an 2D array of image points as the given images are in 2D. The known corners of the undistorted chessboards, called the object points, are stored in a 3D array named ```objpoint```. We need 3D array for object points as we are trying to correct for distortion of 3D objects projected into 2D images. As chessboards the flat, the 3rd co-ordinate in ```objpoint``` is always kept at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I used the ```cv2.calibrateCamera``` function on the image points and the object points to calculate the camera matrix and the distortion coefficients, which are then used to get the undistorted image using the ```cv2.undistort``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, image_size, None, None)\n",
    "dst = cv2.undistort(image, mtx, dist, None, mtx)\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### 1. Distortion Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients that I had saved in the previous step, I write a function called ```undistort_image``` that, given a distorted image, performs undistortion and returns a corrected image. Here is an example: \n",

    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "src = np.float32(\n",
    "    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],\n",
    "    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])\n",
    "dst = np.float32(\n",
    "    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in the following source and destination points:\n",

    "| Source        | Destination   | \n",

    "| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",

    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
